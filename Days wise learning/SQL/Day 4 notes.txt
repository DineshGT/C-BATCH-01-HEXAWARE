Subqueries : Are query within a query which are nested 
--inner query also known as a subquery will be the first to execute. On execution it will be discarded from the memory
--main query is the actual query result we need

Guidelines for using subqueries
1. Enclose the inner Query/subquery in parenthesis
2. Place the subqueries on the right hand side of the comparison condition
3. Use Single-row operators with single-row subquery and multi-row operators with multi-row subqueries

 
Single-Row sub queries : queries that return only one value
 Operators : >, <, >=,<=,<>,=

Multi Row sub queries : queries that return more than 1 value
 operators : in, any, all ( these operators can be used along with single row operators
                             eg : >all , =any, >any, <any)

1. in: Works like an or clause 
2. any : compares value to each value returned by the subquery. Picks rows, if any one matches with the list (inner query)
3. and : compares value to each value returned by the subquery. Picks only those rows that matches with all the values in the list(inner query)

--We can include group by and having clauses in the sub query and not order by. Order by can be used only in the main query
--The select list cannot include any references to values that evaluate to a BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, Array etc
--Cannot use the between operator with the subquery, but can use it within the subquery

--exists/not exists operator : Test for existence of rows in the subquery. 
 - If found, search stops and the inner query returns true.
 - If not found, then inner query returns false and continues to search the remaining rows
 - Equivalent to 'in' and 'not in' operators
 - 'in' and 'not in' involves data retrieval, but exists/non exists does not

Places where we can use Subqueries:
--------------------------------------
 - With select clause
 - with comparison operators
 - with In not In operators
 - with exists or not exists operator
 - with any or all operators
 - with from

Corelated Subquery : is one way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against related table
- Used when a subquery must return different results or set of results for each candidate row considered by the main query
- Considered when we want to answer multipart question, whose answer depends on the value in each row processed by the parent/outer statement/query
