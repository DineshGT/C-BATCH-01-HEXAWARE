What is Database and DBMS ?

Database : storage of inter related data that can be organized in such a fashion that the process of retrieving data is effective and efficient

DBMS : A set of programs that works in coordination to arrive at a solution. 
-An environment that is both convenient and efficient to use. 

Earlier data used to be stored on top of the file systems

Drawbacks of using file systems to store data
  - Data Redundancy and inconsistency
  - Difficulty in accessing data
  - Data Isolation - multiple files and formats
  - Integrity Problems
  - Atomicity of updates
  - Concurrency (access by multiple users)
  - Security

Advantages of Database Approaches :
  Control of data redundancy
  Data consistency
  Program-Data independence
  More Secure
  Concurrent access to data through application programs
  Flexible for application development


Architecture :
  Physical Level :
  Logical Level : customer id = string c001, c002
  Application Level : Viewing Data 

Data Model : A collection of tools for describing
    - Data
    - Data Relationships
    - Data Semantics
    - Data Constraints

Types :
  1. Hierarchical DBMS
  2. Network DBMS
  3. RDBMS
  4. ORDBMS (Multimedia, Hypertext bases databases)
  5. Not only SQL (No SQL - Mongo DB, Redis, Cassandra)
  
  
Relational Model :
 - Data is strictly always stored as tables also known as (Relations)
 - Columns represent data for each instance (attributes)
 - Rows represent an instance of information (tuples)
 - A collection of attributes in a relation/table is known as 'Degree'
 - A collection of tuples in a relation/table is known as ' Cardinality'

ER Modelling :
    
  - Entity :is anything that exists and is distinguishable 
           Example: The Person , the Book
  - Entity Set : a group of similar entities
  - Attribute : properties that describe an entity
        Example : Name, Age, Gender, Address, Degree, BirthDate

  - Each attribute has a value set associated with it.
     Example: Attribute Age associated with value ranges from 18 to 52, attribute Gender should have values male, female etc.

  - Relationship - an association between entities
     - One - One
     - One - Many
     - Many - Many

Entity can be either strong/Regular or weak : Strong Entities are 
Eg : Employee

Weak Entity : A dependant entity on other entities
 Eg : Parttime, Contract, Intern

Keys : Super
       Candidate
       Primary
       Alternate
       Foreign (deptid in employee table is dependant on the deptid of the department table)
       Composite/Compound
       Unique 

Integrity Constraints :
  Constraints are rules/restrictions enforced on the data column/s of a table
  - This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data

1. Domain Integrity Constraint : states that every element from  a relation should respect the data type and or any range, default values etc.
         Check
         Default
         Unique
        // Null or not

2. Entity Integrity : States that no primary key values are null nor duplicates  
        Primary Key

3. Referential Integrity : is specified between 2 relations and is used to maintain consistency among tuples from the 2 relations. 
   Every Foreign key value must have a primary key reference in another table
        Foreign Key 


SQL - Basic Operations
- Data Definition Lang : DDL - (Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate)
- Data Manipulation Lang : DML - (Insert, Update, Delete)
- Data Query Lang : (DQL) - (Select)
- Data Control lang : (DCL) - (Grant, Revoke)
- Transaction Control lang : (TCL) - (Commit, Roll Back)

Unique Key : Similar to primary key but can accept 1 null

Check constraint : used for range of values or comparative values

Default Constraint : when we do not give any values to column 
which has default value it inserts the default else the inserted

System Databases
master db :
temp db :
msdb :
model db :

Constraints are applied either at the column level or table level while defining a table
- They can also be given by altering the table
